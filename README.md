# Edge Detection

The objective of this project is to take 640x480 VGA data from an OV7670 camera and show a filtered image on a VGA monitor using a Gaussian Blur and a Sobel Operator. Coded in Vivado and implemented on Artix-7 FPGA. Logic runs on 96Mhz clock, camera runs on 24Mhz clock.

## Topics Covered:

SCCB (Serial Camera Control Bus) Protocol
- i2c compliant 2-wire protocol used for configurint the OV7670 camera

IEEE-754 Floating Point Protocol
-binary representation of floating-point values
-floating point multiply and add

Xilinx Floating-Point IP
-used in multiply and fused multiply-add configurations

Will be updated as I go.

## Timeline:

12/20: Complete greyscale block
12/25: Complete RTL blocks (byte_combine and byte_convert)
1/10: Complete memory configuration

Will be updated as I go.
