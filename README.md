# Edge Detection

The objective of this project is to take 640x480 VGA data from an OV7670 camera and show a filtered image on a VGA monitor using a Gaussian Blur and a Sobel Operator.

## Topics Covered:

SCCB (Serial Camera Control Bus) Protocol
- i2c compliant 2-wire protocol used for configurint the OV7670 camera

Will be updated as I go.

## Timeline:

12/25: Complete preliminary block diagram of overall system
12/31: Complete byte_combine and byte_convert blocks
1/10: Complete BRAM configuration

Will be updated as I go.

## Documentation:
